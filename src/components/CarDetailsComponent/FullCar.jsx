            Going head to head with BMW’s 5 Series and Mercedes-Benz’s E-Class

            G80’s roots date back to when the Genesis sedan was a model in the
            Hyundai lineup, before Genesis was its own brand. Now serving as the
            middle ground between the sportier G70 and the flagship G90, the G80
            offers an appealing blend of comfort and power.
